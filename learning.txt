What I have learned from this course
One fundamental concept I've learned from this course is the power of version control through Git and GitHub. Specifically, the idea that commits act as critical checkpoints, allowing you to capture the state of your project at any given moment. This ability to track every change, understand who made it, and easily revert to previous versions is incredibly powerful for both individual work and, more importantly, for collaborative projects. It transforms what could be a chaotic process of managing multiple file versions into an organized, traceable, and highly efficient workflow, especially when combined with the collaborative features of GitHub like branching and pull requests.
